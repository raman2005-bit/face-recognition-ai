# Face Recognition using CNN (TensorFlow)

This project demonstrates a real-time face recognition system using:
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras

## Features
- Custom CNN (no pre-trained models)
- Real-time webcam prediction
- Softmax multi-class output
- Modular & clean code structure

## How to Run
1. Install requirements
2. Prepare dataset in `data/`
3. Run `train.py`
4. Run `predict.py`

## Future Upgrades
- More identities
- Face embeddings
- Attendance system
- RL-based interaction
